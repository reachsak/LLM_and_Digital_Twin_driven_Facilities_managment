### Key Features
- **Digital Twin Visualization:** Creates a virtual replica of building systems to provide real-time monitoring and decision support.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Incorporates LLMs for advanced data analysis and natural language processing to improve governance and operational efficiency.
- **AI-Driven Insights:** Provides actionable insights through AI and data analytics to optimize building management and operations.

### Requirements
- Open-source Large language model (e.g., LLaMA)
- Groq API
- Generative AI inference tool. llama.cpp
- Python 3.10
- Raspberry Pi and IoT sensors


## üõ†Ô∏è Detailed Setup Guide

This tutorial uses the [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/) for LLM inference. Follow the steps below to set up the system:

### 1. Install Required Libraries

Install the [PandasAI](https://pandas-ai.com/) library:

### 2. Get Your Groq API Key

Register for a Groq account at: [https://console.groq.com/](https://console.groq.com/)

Once registered, generate your API key.

### 3. Configure the AI Assistant Script

- Navigate to the `AIassistant/` folder.
- Open `AIappchat.py` and insert your Groq API key where required.
- You can specify the LLM model to use (e.g., `llama3`, `mistral`).

---



### 4. Run the AI Assistant App

Use Chainlit to launch the assistant:
chainlit run AIappchat.py


### 5. Test Data Analysis Capabilities
You can test the AI assistant‚Äôs data analysis features using any IoT sensor dataset.
An example dataset is included in the `AIassistant/` folder.
