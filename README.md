## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing a data-driven governance model for smart building facilities management using blockchain technologies, digital twins, and large language models (LLMs). The aim is to enhance facility management through AI-driven insights and digital twin visualizations.

### Key Features

- **Data-Driven Governance Model:** Utilizes blockchain technology for secure and transparent management of building facilities.
- **Digital Twin Visualization:** Creates a virtual replica of building systems to provide real-time monitoring and decision support.
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Incorporates LLMs for advanced data analysis and natural language processing to improve governance and operational efficiency.
- **AI-Driven Insights:** Provides actionable insights through AI and data analytics to optimize building management and operations.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Blockchain technologies (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum)
- Digital Twin technology
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Python 3.x
